# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. This is my first gitHub repository.

Hello world! I'm Jujubex. I really like coding and solving puzzles. I also like eatting sushi and playing Dota2.

Thanks for being interested in knowing more about me. I am honored.
